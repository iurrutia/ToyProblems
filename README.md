## <a name="treeprint">Printing the a nested adjacency list of a tree</a>


See the following video for the problem specifications: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0xjK_6ZoEY

Note: I assumed the child, parent pairs were given as a set of tuples.

Toy problem: Counting orthogonal rectangles in orthogonal point set
From: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuPSibuIKIg

Given a point set P of points that lie on an x/y axis orthogonal grid, count the number of orthogoral rectangles (with axes parallel to the x/y axes).

## <a name="leetcode">Leetcode 30 day challenge</a>

[Challenge link](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/):

- "With many of us around the world being encouraged to stay indoors and work from home, this is the perfect opportunity for you to focus on studying up for future code interviews. In order to help you stay focussed, LeetCode is running the 30-Day LeetCoding Challenge for the month of April. Each day, we'll challenge you to solve a frequently-asked interview problem."
